# Lorien Manual v0.6.0

Drawing tablets are supported and recommended, but you can also just use Keyboard+Mouse. 

## Basic Usage
- Draw with the left mouse button (<kbd>LMB</kbd>) or with your drawing tablet's pen
- Pan/drag across the canvas with the middle mouse button (i recommend to map a button on your pen to the middle mouse button for easy navigation)
- Zoom with the mouse wheel. You can also zoom while holding <kbd>CTRL</kbd> and the middle mouse button <kbd>MMB</kbd> while moving the mose up/down. This is especially useful when using a drawing tablet with a pen.
