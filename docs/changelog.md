## [0.5.0] - 2022-06-12

### Breaking Changes
Version `v0.5` of Lorien features a new SuperEraser, which erases brush strokes as soon as it inserects with them. The previous implementation just painted over new brush strokes, which always had the same color as the background - giving you the illusion of a traditional eraser like in bitmap-based programs (Gimp, Photoshop, etc.). The old implementation has been completely removed in favor of the SuperEraser.
The savefile format did not change. However previously made eraser-strokes will be skipped when loading `.lorien` files. Moreover when saving these files, the eraser-strokes will be permanently lost. 

If you rely on these eraser-strokes: DO NOT UPDATE to this version or BACKUP you `.lorien` files before opening them in the new version.
